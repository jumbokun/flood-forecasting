class HandoffForecastLSTM(BaseModel):
    """
    An encoder/decoder LSTM model class used for forecasting.

    This is a forecasting model that uses a state-handoff to transition from a hindcast sequence (LSTM)
    model to a forecast sequence (LSTM) model. The hindcast model is run from the past up to present
    (the issue time of the forecast) and then passes the cell state and hidden state of the LSTM into
    a (nonlinear) handoff network, which is then used to initialize the cell state and hidden state of a
    new LSTM that rolls out over the forecast period. The handoff network is implemented as a custom FC
    network, which can have multiple layers. The handoff network is implemented using the
    ``state_handoff_network`` config parameter.

    The hindcast and forecast LSTMs have different weights and biases, different heads, and can have
    different embedding networks, as defined by ``hindcast_embedding`` and ``forecast_embedding`` in the
    config. The hidden size of the hindcast LSTM is set using the ``hindcast_hidden_size`` config parameter
    and the hidden size of the forecast LSTM is set using the ``forecast_hidden_size`` config parameter,
    which both default to ``hidden_size`` if not set explicitly.

    The handoff forecast LSTM model can implement a delayed handoff, such that the handoff between the
    hindcast and forecast LSTM occurs prior to the forecast issue time. This is controlled by the
    ``forecast_overlap`` parameter in the config file. The forecast and hindcast LSTMs run concurrently
    for the number of timesteps indicated by ``forecast_overlap``. We recommend using the
    ``ForecastOverlapMSERegularization`` regularization option to regularize the loss function by
    (dis)agreement between the overlapping portion of the hindcast and forecast LSTMs. This regularization
    term can be requested by setting  the ``regularization`` parameter list in the config file to include
    ``forecast_overlap``. The model architecture is based on [#]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cfg : Config
        The run configuration.
